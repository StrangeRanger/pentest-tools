This repository contains a collection of tools and scripts that I have developed or modified for penetration testing purposes. Although many of these tools perform tasks already found in other toolsets, having a standalone script can be helpful in certain situations. One of my goals with this repository and creating these tools is to learn and improve my understanding and skills in penetration testing.

Below, I have listed all the existing tools and scripts in this repository. If I know of similar tools that are more popular or well-known, I have also included a link to them.

## Tools and Scripts

### Network Tools

- [network-discovery.bash](Network%20Discovery/): Performs a network scan within a given range to identify active hosts on a network.
    - Similar tools: [nmap](https://nmap.org/), [netdiscover](https://github.com/netdiscover-scanner/netdiscover), [arp-scan](https://github.com/royhills/arp-scan)

## Getting Started

To get started with any of these tools, ensure you have installed any necessary dependencies. You can clone the repository and start using the tools as per the usage instructions provided for or by each script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StrangeRanger/pentest-tools
cd pentest-tools
```

### Usage

Each tool or script has its own usage instructions, which can be found by running the script with the `-h` or `--help` flag or without arguments.
